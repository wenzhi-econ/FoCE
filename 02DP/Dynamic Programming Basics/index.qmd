# Preface {.unnumbered}

This website stores my notes on solving simply dynamic programming problems in economics using Python. Theses are based on the course [Foundation of Computational Economics, ANU, 2021](https://github.com/fediskhakov/CompEcon).

The notes focus on the following three points:
1. Create a proper Python object to represent an economics model.
2. Conduct unit tests when developing model methods to solve the model.
3. Use type hinting to track down the calculation process, and minimize potential errors in each step.

The notes do not necessarily present the best numerical methods and solution methods to deal with these models. It is more programming-oriented, aiming to improve my Python skills to solve, simulate, and estimate an economics model.
