This repository stores my replication of some of the materials from the course [Foundation of Computational Economics, ANU, 2021](https://github.com/fediskhakov/CompEcon).

The course is a good introduction of computational economics using Python. More importantly, it has online recordings: https://www.youtube.com/@fedoriskhakov6426.
